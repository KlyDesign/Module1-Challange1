User story from assignment: "AS A marketing agency

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines" from Module 1 Challange 1 README.md

Two classes I consolidated the CSS with were

    .left-block for the titles "Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing" 
    for the .left block <div> section in included a matching id to the unordered list section of the header

    .benefit-title to consolidate teh benefit section to the right
